## What is Korga planned to be?

Korga stands for the german term _**K**irchen **Orga**nisation_ (church organization).
Unlike all other church management systems known to the author, Korga is not designed to be an all-in-one solution for churches.
It is rather the link between several open source applications, while it itself only provides church-specific functionality.
